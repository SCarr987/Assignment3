Introduction
------------

This codebook describes each variable and the values in the tidy dataset for a Coursera class project. The dataset is a data frame, grouped by two factors: subject and activity. The dimensions are 180, 68. The sixty-eight variables were derived from all variables in which a mean \[mean()\] or standard deviation \[sd()\] were present in the original dataset. The observations represent the means for data from 30 subjects participating in each of 6 activities (30\*6 = 180).

Variables in the dataset
------------------------

The observations are the means by subject and activity for each of the 68 variables selected. Features consititute the column headers, and are derived summary measurements from a smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope. These primarily concern triaxial linear acceleration and triaxial angular velocity measurements, measured in the time domain (seconds) or frequency domain (Hz).

Rationale for summary choices
-----------------------------

The mean of the dataset, by subject and activity, were calculated based upon assignment directions.

Quoted data collection methods and experimental design
------------------------------------------------------

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features\_info.txt' for more details.
